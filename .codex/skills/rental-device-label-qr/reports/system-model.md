# System Model

Skill: `rental-device-label-qr`

- Stability score: `100/100`
- Stability band: `system-ready`
- Doctrine: Structure drives behavior: improve the boundary, feedback loops, drift watch, and leverage points before adding weight.

## System Boundary Map

- Owned job: Generate repeatable, print-ready rental device QR label packages in the approved shop-label layout.
- Output boundary: Verified 20x40 mm 600 DPI PNG labels, A4 print PDF, preview sheet, normalized manifest, and ZIP archive.
- Maturity assumption: `production`
- Input boundary:
  - A CSV or TSV device manifest containing device_no, serial_number, and a pre-signed QR payload.
- Non-goals:
  - Do not create or expose signing secrets, mutate production data, change the CRD1 protocol, or route generic QR design tasks here.
- Constraints:
  - Keep secrets and production credentials outside the skill; require 100 percent QR decode equality; print at 100 percent scale.
- Standards:
  - Every generated PNG must be 945x472 at 600 DPI, every QR must decode to the exact provided payload, sequence and filenames must be deterministic, and the PDF must be valid A4.
- Human judgment boundary:
  - Infer non-core gaps visibly; ask one focused clarification only for an unresolved core job, primary output, or explicit direction conflict.
  - Escalate visible tradeoffs when benchmark patterns conflict with local privacy, naming, or governance constraints.
  - Do not silently broaden the skill into adjacent jobs just because the examples are nearby.

## Feedback Loops

### Intent boundary loop

- Signal: Intent confidence score is 100/100.
- Response: Ask only the highest-leverage clarification before adding package weight.
- Evidence: reports/intent-confidence.md and reports/intent-dialogue.md

### Reference synthesis loop

- Signal: Benchmark patterns are useful only after they are abstracted into borrow and avoid guidance.
- Response: Borrow one pattern at a time and keep the rest as reviewer-visible evidence.
- Evidence: reports/reference-synthesis.md
- Current patterns:
  - Borrow a first-time operator flow that explains itself before it asks for more structure.
  - Borrow a review checkpoint wherever trust matters more than raw speed.
  - Borrow the discipline of defining what the skill should not own before growing the package.
  - Learn what quality, tone, workflow shape, or operating standard the user wants to preserve.
  - Do not mimic product polish that adds UI bulk without improving clarity.

### Output quality loop

- Signal: Generated output may fail in recurring domain-specific ways.
- Response: Apply predicted output-risk families as self-repair checks before final output.
- Evidence: reports/output-risk-profile.md
- Current risk families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Code and command safety
  - Tone and specificity

### Reviewer feedback loop

- Signal: Human review catches drift that static checks miss.
- Response: Capture lightweight feedback and turn repeated findings into gates or references.
- Evidence: reports/review-viewer.html and feedback records

### Lifecycle loop

- Signal: As reuse grows, the skill needs stronger gates, ownership, and regression evidence.
- Response: Promote only when the next gate improves reliability more than context cost.
- Evidence: manifest.json, reports/iteration-directions.md, and governance checks

## Delay And Drift Watch

### Trigger drift

- Watch signal: Users start invoking the skill for adjacent one-off or explanation-only requests.
- Countermeasure: Add near-neighbor exclusions and route evals before expanding workflow steps.
- Cadence: per trigger or description change

### Output drift

- Watch signal: Outputs remain valid but become generic, cluttered, or weakly aligned with the user's domain.
- Countermeasure: Refresh output-risk and artifact-design profiles, then add one self-repair check.
- Cadence: after the first 3-5 real uses
- Risk families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Code and command safety
  - Tone and specificity

### Reference drift

- Watch signal: Borrowed benchmark patterns no longer fit the local job or add ceremony without payoff.
- Countermeasure: Re-run reference synthesis and keep only patterns that improve the current boundary.
- Cadence: per material benchmark or product assumption change

### Governance drift

- Watch signal: Skill usage becomes team-critical while ownership, review cadence, or rollback evidence stays informal.
- Countermeasure: Promote maturity tier and add reviewer-visible lifecycle evidence.
- Cadence: monthly

## Failure Pattern Map

### Boundary failure

- Symptom: The skill handles nearby requests that were never part of the recurring job.
- Repair: Narrow the description and add explicit non-goals before adding more execution steps.

### Feedback gap

- Symptom: The skill has rules but no signal telling authors which rule should change after use.
- Repair: Turn repeated reviewer feedback into one eval, one reference note, or one self-repair check.

### Output degradation

- Symptom: The result is structurally correct but generic, cluttered, or weakly matched to the user's domain.
- Repair: Use output-risk families as pre-final checks.
- Current Risk Families:
  - Markdown readability
  - Citation and footnote clutter
  - Screenshot and visual capture
  - Code and command safety
  - Tone and specificity

### Prompt-behavior mismatch

- Symptom: The role, task, and format are copied from a prompt instead of becoming stable skill behavior.
- Repair: Convert reusable role/task/format assumptions into workflow, reports, or references.

## Highest Leverage Moves

### 2. Tune the frontmatter description

- Why: The description is the highest-leverage routing surface.
- Move: Name the recurring job, expected input, output, and strongest non-goal in compact language.

### 3. Install output self-repair checks

- Why: The likely failure families are: Markdown readability, Citation and footnote clutter, Screenshot and visual capture.
- Move: Add only the checks that prevent recurring output mistakes.

### 4. Borrow one pattern, not a whole product

- Why: External references improve quality when reduced to structure, not copied as surface style.
- Move: Start from: Borrow a first-time operator flow that explains itself before it asks for more structure.

### 5. Close the lifecycle loop

- Why: Team-reused skills need visible ownership, review cadence, and regression evidence.
- Move: Keep manifest, review viewer, and iteration directions aligned after each material change.

## Reviewer Use

- Reviewer should ask whether the skill's structure will keep producing the desired behavior after repeated real use.
- Prefer changing the system boundary, feedback loop, or leverage point before adding more prose.
- If a problem repeats, convert it into a named failure pattern and one regression check.
